## Summary

The best opportunities for AI agents in 2025 include:

1. **Customer Service**: AI-enhanced tools can improve engagement and satisfaction by providing personalized support and resolving issues efficiently. According to McKinsey, companies can achieve a reimagined vision for customer service by matching AI-powered tools with core technology and data across all customer touchpoints. This can lead to increased customer engagement, resulting in increased cross-sell and upsell opportunities while reducing cost-to-serve.
2. **Operational Efficiency**: AI projects can enhance business processes, reducing costs and improving productivity. By leveraging AI and technology, companies can support proactive and personalized customer engagement through self-serve tools, revamped apps, new interfaces, dynamic interactive voice response (IVR), and chat.
3. **Personalized, Digitally Enabled Engagement**: At the most advanced end of the maturity scale, companies are delivering proactive, service-led engagement, which lets them handle more than 95 percent of their service interactions via AI and digital channels.

To achieve the promise of AI-enabled customer service, companies can follow a five-level journey of investment, learning, and improvement:

Level 1: Manual and high-touch, based on paper forms and offered largely via assisted channels.
Level 2: Partly automated and basic digital channels, with digitization and automation of servicing in assisted channels.
Level 3: Accessible and speedy service via digital channels, with self-servicing on select channels and a focus on enabling end-to-end resolution.
Level 4: Proactive and efficient engagement deploying AI-enabled tech, with self-servicing enabled by proactive customer interactions and conversational user experience (UX).
Level 5: Personalized, digitally enabled engagement, bringing back the human touch via predictive intent recognition.

By adopting AI-powered tools and technology, companies can transform their customer service experience, providing personalized and efficient support to customers while reducing costs and improving productivity.
